# The DigitalGaia manifesto

The following are some fundamental tenets guiding how the DigitalGaia collective operates:

- **we write free software**, copyright is DigitalGaia

- **we work towards sustainability, not profits.** The collective is meant to be a specific size and not grow over time. If it ends up doing that it should be split into multiple "copies" of the collective the same way as for instance the human body is made of multiple cells, not a giant one that grew. Growth is also fractal in the sense that 5 collectives can join together and form a "super-collective" in the same way that 5 persons joined together to form a single collective.

- **we choose freely what we work on**

  no one is required to work on anything on particular, if people want to team up together they are free to do it though, and can rescind that collaboration whenever

  people choose to do what they want to do with their time (except for some needed coordination stuff) (also: [Just for Fun. No, Really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/) [[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33255920)]

  the idea is that there is more symbiosis when a working structure emerges by itself rather than  being imposed by a central authority, where each participant use their skillset as they most see fit

- we strive for quality in code, not deadlines. Documentation is encouraged and appreciated, especially when kept up-to-date, tests are part of the specs/doc and should be readable.

- we need to be antifragile

  -> decisions are collective, 1 human 1 vote (unless we find something better)
