# The DigitalGaia manifesto

"DigitalGaia is an experiment in setting up a team first before having a project and then find that project together, instead of choosing a project first and then setting up a team according to it."

the idea is that a team will learn to work better without the pressure of a project and then be more efficient in developing that project. In contrast, getting a hodge-podge team trying to work on a project will accumulate friction in ways of working together where some of it gets fixed over time but not all of it, and we end up having these residual inefficiencies that never get fixed.

The following are some fundamental tenets guiding how the DigitalGaia collective operates:

- we write free software, copyright is DigitalGaia

- libre association of projects

  no one is required to work on anything on particular, if people want to team up together they are free to do it though, and can rescind that collaboration whenever

  people choose to do what they want to do with their time (except for some needed coordination stuff) (also: [Just for Fun. No, Really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/) [[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33255920)]

  the idea is that there is more symbiosis when a working structure emerges by itself rather than  being imposed by a central authority, where each participant use their skillset as they most see fit

- we strive for quality in code, not deadlines. Documentation is encouraged and appreciated, especially when kept up-to-date, tests are part of the specs/doc and should be readable.

- we need to be antifragile

  -> decisions are collective, 1 human 1 vote (unless we find something better)

- security needs to be enforced all the time, we want to have proper access to resources. Nothing shared all or public by default. Take care of access with (potentially old) SSH keys on servers.

*** why the name?

DigitalGaia because I believe in a world that is both respectful of
our planet and embraces technology. I don't think that one should exclude
the other, and I believe very strongly in the power of decentralization
to help us build a better world that is inclusive for everyone and doesn't
create central failure points that accreted through concentration of money,
power and greed.

Having recently come accross Nassim Nicholas Taleb's writings, I strongly
believe that anti-fragile systems are now required to run the world's economy,
and I do believe that BitShares (and Bitcoin, and all decentralized systems
in general) are such anti-fragile systems.
