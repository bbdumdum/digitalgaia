# Timeline

## 1. Learning phase, organization and infrastructure setup

*1-2 years of total freedom of projects*

Main goal is to learn and sharpen one's knives: programming languages, infrastructure setup, collaboration model setup (matrix, github, etc.)

```{note}
You go here into a more concrete definition of the work and collaboration: writing software.
```
Workflows should be defined and refined, and everyone is encouraged to follow them diligently. Setting this up early allows us to have a much more streamlined workflow naturally in place for the future.

This is also the opportunity to go for random coursera classes, etc.

should already have the brainstorming sessions every week. Need to find a way to properly record them effortlessly, but in a way to gives them utility afterwards (not sure about that: taking minutes is always a burden that nobody wants to shoulder and they are never read afterwards. audio sessions should be informative only (ie: information-sharing), whereas important decisions need to happen in an asynchronous way (more efficient)).

```{note}
Transcription and LLM summarization models sound like useful here. Can we can get a value-adding workflow by setting up a recording-minutes worflow that integrate them?

Can this be part of a more general 'knowledge base' and 'documentation' effort?
```


## 2. Project(s) inception

*2 years of project definition*

People shoud find 1 or more projects they want to work on, alone or in collaboration with other people

They should be encouraged to be lead in at least 1 project, but this is not required.



## 3. Project maturity

*2 years of production / project maturity*

Money should start coming in this time, if appreciation of crypto assets didn't extend that period

```{note}
Can maybe clarify that part, do you expect the project to be mature and revenue-generating after 2 yrs of definition and then 2 yrs of production? What level of revenue generation to expect from the project itself? 

If a project is production-grade and can add value, business dev/marketing/sales can theoretically scale revenue. What is a minimum set of tasks necessary to 'test a market', at least in a very basic form?, and know if more work/money needs to be invested for comercialization / donation-based / consulting based.

I understand you want to avoid going into a full business or financial plan, but developing on the financials can give a more solid basis to the project.

In general, you could also expand the `business model` part to explain what financiation to expect from project, and what from other collective / contributors sources. Are you open to other sources (subventions, donations)? E.g. subvention may require specific forms of collective.
```

**Business model:** software licensing (GPL), consulting (e.g.: [SourceHut consultancy][srht]), possibly trading and/or management of crypto-assets or other investments in spinoffs
