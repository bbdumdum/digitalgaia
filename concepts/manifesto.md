# The DigitalGaia manifesto

The following are some fundamental tenets guiding how the DigitalGaia collective operates:

- **we write free software**, copyright is DigitalGaia

```{note} Based on followup references to the work and tools, this seems to imply that to>  whole project is about writing code/software. I have interest in other project outputs that are not code: knowledge, models, data sets, journalistic reports, hardware. While those outputs can be produced according to the principles of free software, and free software would be part of them, they are not limited to it. Do you want to make room to this or would rather stick to first definition, for scope and simplicity?``` 

- **we strive for quality in code, not deadlines**

  Documentation is encouraged and appreciated, especially when kept up-to-date. Tests are part of the specs/doc and should be readable.

```{note} I think the project should put in place mechanisms not only to encourage and appreciate, but to enforce maintaining up-to-date wiki-like documentation in a usable form. Maintaining documentation includes: suggesting and creating new content, peer-to-peer reviewing, pruning old content, reorganizing documentation structure. (other tasks?) I can relate to experience with some orgs, where insufficient care is given in maintaining documentation. Up to date documentation enables async and decentralized work contributions, yet it is usually only encouraged. Some devs think code (including tests) is the only needed documentation, others think other people should write and maintaing the doc. Given this, I have seen documentation content displaced from wiki-like pages to more synchronous chat rooms or zoom meetings.  In the other hand LLM, voice transcription, embedding and RAG tech provides a way to transfer knowledge from informal - chat / voice syncronous to wiki-like async ``` 

- **we work towards sustainability, not profits**

  The collective is meant to be a specific size and not grow over time.

```{note} Is there a growth period? Is the size of the collective dependent of what it wants to do? Example: if a collective has extensive experience in Software eng, coding, and medical, but not in IA, is it better for existing members to learn the new skills (maybe contracting an external expert to drive them) or to grow to include someone with a new skillset? Questions above are partly answered in https://digitalgaia.net/concepts/philosophy.html - important.```

If it ends up doing that it should be split into multiple "copies" of the collective the same way as for instance the human body is made of multiple cells, not a giant one that grew. Growth is also fractal in the sense that 5 collectives can join together and form a "super-collective" in the same way that 5 persons joined together to form a single collective.

- **we choose freely what we work on**

  No one is required to work on anything on particular, if people want to team up to work on a common project they are free to do it and can rescind that collaboration whenever

  People choose to do what they want to do with their time (except for some needed coordination stuff) (also: [Just for Fun. No, Really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/) [[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33255920)])

  The idea is that there is more symbiosis when a working structure emerges by itself through free will rather than be imposed by a central authority. That way, each participant can use their skillset to their best potential instead of being assigned to a task that doesn't necessarily fit them.

- **we need to be resilient / antifragile**

  Decisions are collective, 1 human 1 vote (unless we find something better)
