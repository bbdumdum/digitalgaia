# Timeline

## 1. Learning phase, organization and infrastructure setup

1-2 years of total freedom of main projects (except maybe hobby projects, eg: 8bit synth in rust), but main goal is to learn and sharpen one's knives: programming languages, infrastructure setup, collaboration model setup (matrix, github, etc.)

Workflows should be defined and refined, and everyone is encouraged to follow them diligently. Setting this up early allows us to have a much more streamlined workflow naturally in place for the future.<br>

<br>

can also go for random coursera classes, etc.

should already have the brainstorming sessions every week. Need to find a way to properly record them effortlessly, but in a way to gives them utility afterwards (not sure about that: taking minutes is always a burden that nobody wants to shoulder and they are never read afterwards. audio sessions should be informative only (ie: information-sharing), whereas important decisions need to happen in an asynchronous way (more efficient)).

possibility to start half-time if it makes a transition smoother<br>

## 2. Project(s) inception

2 years of project definition

people shoud find 1 or more projects they want to work on, alone or in collaboration with other people<br>

they should be encouraged to be lead in at least 1 project, but this is not required



## 3. Project maturity

- 2 years of production / project maturity<br>

money should start coming in this time, if appreciation of crypto assets didn't extend that period
- business model: software licensing (GPL), consulting (e.g.: [SourceHut consultancy][srht]), possibly trading and/or management of crypto-assets or other investments in spinoffs
