```{admonition} Synopsis
:class: important

DigitalGaia is an experiment in setting up a team first before having a project and subsequently find that project together, instead of choosing a project first and then setting up a team according to it.
```

the idea is that a team will learn to work better without the pressure of a project and then be more efficient in developing that project. In contrast, getting a hodge-podge team trying to work on a project will accumulate friction in ways of working together where some of it gets fixed over time but not all of it, and we end up having these residual inefficiencies that never get fixed.
