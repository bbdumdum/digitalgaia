```{admonition} Synopsis
:class: important

DigitalGaia is an experiment in setting up a team first before having a project and subsequently find that project together, instead of the usual way of starting with a project or set goal and then finding team members to work on it.
```

The idea is that a team will learn how to work together without the pressure of a project and then be more efficient in developing that project.

In contrast, getting a hodge-podge team trying to work on a project will accumulate friction in the collaboration and work processes where some of it gets fixed over time but not all of it, and we end up having these residual inefficiencies that never get fixed.
