need to figure out if/how company/org can have assets in crypto instead of fiat

status: autonomo<br>

people can work when they want, and take holidays when they want

projects have independent accountancy than the digitalgaia collective<br>

when money comes in, it goes 50/50 between the digitalgaia collective and the project itself. The project can use this money to buy resources for itself, such as more servers, contractors, designers, etc.<br>

the digitalgaia collective uses the funds to pay for the people (kind of UBI, in a way). This ensure a living for the people, and frees them to really work on what they want. If a project wants to fund more resources, it needs to be self-sustainable. A project can always ask the digitalgaia collective to fund it for a certain amount (potentially traded against a better deal for returns), if it is voted at a majority (decision to be recorded in an RFC).
