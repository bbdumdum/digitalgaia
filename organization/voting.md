# Voting on decisions

## About the number 5

check conway's law: "Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

5 people seems to be a right number to start with

- too few, and they end up being the elder when the company grows and inherit some unspoken (and potentially unchallengeable) authority
- too many, and there's too much noise for a structure to emerge (also: it's expensive!)

2 is too few, no diversity: just a 2-person team

3 could be, but risk of going 2 vs 1 in decision making is high and very likely resulting in the death of the structure<br>

4 is too symmetric: it might just end up being 2 vs 2, which is 2x the case with 2 persons, which we have seen doesn't work<br>

5 seems to not introduce too many established structures

## Voting processes

board is composed of 5 people, each 1 vote. votes are cryptographically signed.<br>

decision is taken with majority, and everyone needs to vote. Exceptionally, a decision can be taken by only 4 members if they all agree, i.e. all 4 vote for the same resolution.<br>

board changes can happen and need to be voted upon

eviction of one person cannot happen with simple majority, it needs to have 4 votes.

board has multisig authority over the main account (which main account?) (3-of-5, 4-of-5?)
