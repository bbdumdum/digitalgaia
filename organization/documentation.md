# Documentation writing

documentation should be easy to edit (wiki-style), versioned (git) and able to output to a static website.

a near wiki-like experience can be achieved with sphinx doc being built and pushed immediately to prod as a CI actions from github when a commit is pushed. Repo has no named branches other than develop, and represent a continuous line in time.

there should be official documentation for projects, but also wiki-style unstructured general documentation, links to to interesting articles, thoughts for possible different designs or new features, ideas for governance, etc.

there is also a handbook for the collective, containing amongst other the digitalgaia manifesto

we could have, say, 1 week / year where we stop all activity and only review, update and fix documentation of all products / internal infrastructure (kind of a spring cleaning week).

## Possible tools for documentation

investigate following tools:

- [https://www.gitbook.com/](<https://www.gitbook.com/>) (e.g., see: [https://kb.fioprotocol.io/foundation/foundation-board](<https://kb.fioprotocol.io/foundation/foundation-board>))
- [https://js.wiki/](<https://js.wiki/>) (possibly check TiddlyWiki too)
- [https://www.docsy.dev](<https://www.docsy.dev>)
- use sphinx? something like docusaurus? ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27132485](<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27132485>)) (nice [sphinx theme](<https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo>) / other [sphinx theme](<https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/sxtp7h/new_sphinx_theme/>))
