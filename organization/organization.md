## Meetings

**weekly / monthly meetings on readings / interesting articles / potential new projects**

people should talk about 1 (or more) articles, piece of news, or brainstorming idea of<br>

potential new/fun/interesting projects

**meetings are audio-only, we don't want webcam. It's freer this way, less physical**<br>

constraints to participate in meeting. We can use video for slides, images, etc.<br>

own matrix server

meetings should be weekly 2 hours, no planning or prepared questions, just open<br>

discussion where everyone raises whatever question is needed by them

anything goes as to what can be talked about, people are also encouraged to talk about their recent work if they have major changes they want to share with the others

\-> no need for minutes, no one wants to write them, and no one reads them. If anything important needs to be written, this should happen as a documentation writing item of some sort (eg: in linear).



## Standard Operating Procedures

improvements to software should be made using RFC-style proposals (or BIP, EIP, etc., eg: [https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips](https://github.com/fioprotocol/fips))

[How to Stop Endless Discussions](<https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/>) [[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149)]

rst template should be provided containing required sections (eg: NABC, etc. see HN comments, for instance also rename "competitors" to "alternatives")

check Linear's [method](https://linear.app/method) for issue tracking

code review should be a daily task, and we may need to dedicate up to 20% of a day to it.

**code review is meant to foster shared ownership of the code instead of one maintainer and various ad-hoc helpers**
