# Infrastructure

Linear workspace: [https://linear.app/digitalgaia/](<https://linear.app/digitalgaia/>)

research for which internal tools to use should be made as RFC/decision style document:

- password manager (bitwarden, see also: [https://bitwarden.com/products/send/](<https://bitwarden.com/products/send/>))<br>

see [discussion about password managers](<https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/nt7g1u/password_managers/>), [turning off auto-fill for pw managers](<https://reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/ommw21/you_should_turn_off_autofill_in_your_password/>)
- communication (matrix, element, zulip)
- file sharing (tresorit, syncthing?)
- bug tracking (linear)
- source code hosting (github)
- CI (?)
- sysadmin/devops (pyinfra) (see also network topologies (tailscale etc.) in hacking.org > netsec)

upgrade of critical infrastructure should be done in a meeting with everyone watching.<br>

This shares information about what is done, how it is done, and ensures no one is working during that time.
