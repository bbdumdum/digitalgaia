# Random thoughts about the concept

## organization

check Dan's article about [independent parties vs. general partnership](https://hive.blog/fractally/@dan/implications-of-eden-s-declaration-of-independence)

Some "tech coops", maybe good source of inspiration
https://tech-coops.xyz/

## communication

integrate some remarks/comments about the apolitical nature of the project, we also don't have a code of conduct because this is all about the technology (neutral). SJW can just fuck off! And yeah, we should be nice to each other, but that isn't a thing from the project, it's just good human behavior. We should operate according to [Crocker's rules](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/crockers-rules)

also check [Kraken culture](https://kraken-culture.notion.site/) document

## symbolism

Technology is often being touted as antithetical to nature; inorganic vs organic, order vs chaos, hard vs soft, cold/dead vs alive…

We believe it doesn’t have to be so

Digital gaia: a technology and nature symbiosis project

Relation to solarpunk?
