# Random thoughts about the concept

## organization

check Dan's article about [independent parties vs. general partnership](https://hive.blog/fractally/@dan/implications-of-eden-s-declaration-of-independence)

## communication

integrate some remarks/comments about the apolitical nature of the project, we also don't have a code of conduct because this is all about the technology (neutral). SJW can just fuck off! And yeah, we should be nice to each other, but that isn't a thing from the project, it's just good human behavior. We should operate according to [Crocker's rules](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/crockers-rules)

also check [Kraken culture](https://kraken-culture.notion.site/) document

## symbolism

Technology is often being touted as antithetical to nature; inorganic vs organic, order vs chaos, hard vs soft, cold/dead vs alive…

We believe it doesn’t have to be so

Digital gaia: a technology and nature symbiosis project

Relation to solarpunk?

```{note}

*old comment about the digitalgaia name*

**why the name?**

DigitalGaia because I believe in a world that is both respectful of
our planet and embraces technology. I don't think that one should exclude
the other, and I believe very strongly in the power of decentralization
to help us build a better world that is inclusive for everyone and doesn't
create central failure points that accreted through concentration of money,
power and greed.

Having recently come accross Nassim Nicholas Taleb's writings, I strongly
believe that anti-fragile systems are now required to run the world's economy,
and I do believe that BitShares (and Bitcoin, and all decentralized systems
in general) are such anti-fragile systems.
